# WebDevProject

This is a project that I have been working on with a web development bootcamp.

It was built with Node.js and utilizes Express-js and MongoDB as well as many packages. 
Packages can be found in packages.json.

It is still a work in progress, so it may have a few bugs that need to be ironed out.
